# dotfiles

Cybersecurity based dotfiles in `.kali-zshrc` which works with the base Kali install.

Dotfiles for Ubuntu in `.ubuntu-bashrc`. Requires installing oh-my-zsh, so run `install.sh`.

## Key Additions

### nfast()

Quickly scans a host with nmap - does all ports with a high minimum rate, good for CTFs

### g()

Shortcut for git, from https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles

### listen()

Creates a netcat listener. Listens on 9001 with no args, or on a port of your choice with an arg

### websrv

Alias that launches a python server on `80` in `~/Documents/web/`. Put common enumeration/pivoting files here such as chisel, linpeas, etc. Other aliases assume that certain files are in here with a specific name. Python may need capabilities to run on port 80 without `sudo` but this is included by default on Kali

### pysrv

Python server in current directory

### chiselsrv

Starts a chisel server in reverse mode

### run-ghidra

Runs ghidra...

### \*.vpn

These aliases launch openvpn with a variety of `.ovpn` files. Rename your HTB season, TryHackMe, etc ovpn files as described for these aliases to work

### updaterc

Sources the `.zshrc` file because I'm not enough of a Linux power user to be bothered with an install script just yet

### mcd

Standard `mkdir` and `cd` alias

## Roadmap

- [ ] Improve prompt ðŸ’€
  - [ ] Strip the guff from the Kali prompt (multi lines, skull emojis etc)
  - [ ] Add the IP of tun0 if it's connected
  - [ ] Shorten the filepath if it's going to make the prompt very long (as we're now working on one line)
- [ ] Install script
  - [ ] Give python necessary capabilities
  - [ ] Output suggested commands to download good scripts for `~/Documents/web/` e.g. `wget https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/download/v1.8.1/chisel_1.8.1_linux_arm64.gz -O ~/Documents/web/chisel_linux_64.gz && gunzip ~/Documents/web/chisel_linux_64.gz`
